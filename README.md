The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Use machine learning and neural networks as well as the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Step 1: Preprocess the Data
Use Pandas and scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler() to preprocess the dataset. 

### Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Use TensorFlow to design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.

### Step 3: Optimize the Model
Use TensorFlow to optimize model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
